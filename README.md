# Get started with Swift concurrency
Swift Concurrency, introduced in Swift 5.5, brings new concepts like async/await, Actor, and Task that make asynchronous programming more intuitive and safe.

This repository serves as personal learning space for Swift Concurrency, where I document knowledge gained through study, store code examples used in real projects, and organize implementation tips and pitfalls encountered along the way. I also collect helpful articles and save various practice codes to build Swift Concurrency learning archive.
